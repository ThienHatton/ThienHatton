              <h2>Three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
               
              <p>
                During the core learning i found out that i have growth alot, i learn how to be patience as well as listening to other peoples,
                 i have also learn that sometime i dont know what everything are and thats fine.
                </p>

                <h2> Role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

                    <p>
                        These are really important as these show that we are human that we can work, study, living and be happy with other peoples. As 
                        programing we have to be encourage these since we are human not machine as these will keep you back on track if you lostin the sea of code and computer. 
                    </p>
                
                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

                    <p>
                      I think what has suprised me about core learning is how well delivered and supported it is at Dev Academy. Its really nice that all the excercise
                      is really challenging not in the hard way but in a way that student can study it while studying themself.
                    </p>

                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

                <p>
                  The most challenging would be opening with other peoples as many of the core learning is about human and social skill that i think i lack of.
                </p> 
                
                <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>

                <p> 
                  I think you guys did that because you guy know that sometime a coder can be hard sometime they even isolating themself and some lack of skills like me and as a work enviroment you guys want it to be as good as possible so everybody can be happy while working.
                </p>

                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
                
                    <p>
                      No i think core learning is really helpful its slowly help me less having my social anxiety atack as i talk and work with other peoples.
