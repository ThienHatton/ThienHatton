            <h2>1. Being Blocked</h2>
                 
              <p>
                There were alot of time during this sprint were i was blocked. A ll of them require so many new knowledge and also require my reseach and problem solving thinking. The only way i can think of at the time will be reading the error message,
                 looking at hint, rewrite my code and keep testing, searching until i know what iam doing.
                Honestly i fell constantly confused and overwhelmed knowing how much I don't know the only comfort i took in is when i saw some task that i can do and understand it to create a new way to solve the task. I learned that working as a dev is hard, learned how to use JavaScript is hard,
                probably even harder when i finish DEV.
              </p>

                <h2>2. Solving a problem</h2>

                    <p>
                      I don't know if i have ever solved a problem elegantly way but i solved my problem with alot of trial and error, sometime i have to rewrite aswell. During the process i feel like an old blinded man trying to find the right direction to go. I have learned that 
                      this method is just a temporary method to solve problem and i need to find a better way to solve it in the future.
                     </p>
                
                <h2>3. How confident i feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes: </h2>
                    <p>
                      Pseudocode: This is the method that iam not good at at all i have tried it but i can write only a little amount of word and can't even explain it right. <br>
                      Trying something: This is the method that im confident in since i have used this since the course started. <br>
                      Rubber ducky method: I have try out this method but i just cant get used to it yet so i cant say that im good or bad at it. <br>
                      Reading error messages: This is the method that i think would be a 50/50 chance since sometime i understand it sometime i dont and that really create confusion. <br>
                      Console.logging: With this method i have using it more frequently and quite enjoy it since it help me alot and told me that my code outcome is what i want. <br>
                      Googling: This is the method that im good at but that's not to say that when I find useful information I know what to do with it though! <br>
                      Asking peers for help: I am not confident in this one even tho i have tried and success a few time but there just something in my mind stop me from doing in. <br>
                      Asking coaches: I had some good example and help this week from my facilitator and i found it really helpful so im gonna continue to ask. <br>
                      Reflection: I do this frequently but im not so sure if i good or bad at it.
